# Good idea!

List and rank your ideas.

## Works offline

This is a progressive web app that serves a cached
version of the UI by default, even when you have no connection!

## Saves ideas locally

Ideas are saved and read from your browsers local database. Your ideas are never
sent to a server, so nobody else knows they even exist!

The downside with this is that **if** your browser decides to wipe its local
database, then your list of ideas will be lost forever. That's why it's
recommended to download your ideas to file each time you finish working on them
â€” just in case!
