## Work offline

This is a progressive web app that serves a cached
version of the UI by default, even when you have no connection!

## Save ideas locally

Ideas are saved and read from your browsers local database. Your ideas are never
sent to a server, so nobody else ever knows of their existence!

The downside with this is that **if** your browser decides to wipe its local
database, then your list of ideas will be lost forever. That's why it's
recommended to download your ideas to file each time you finish working on them
â€” just in case!
